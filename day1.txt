# MACHINE LEARNING
-> Method of teaching computers to learn from data, without being explicitly programmed>
   1. Learning from data
   2. Choosing a Mode(model is a mathematical structure or function that makes predictions or decisions.)
      a. linear Regression(for predicting numbers)
      b. Decision Trees(for yes/no decisions)
      c. Neural Networks(for complex tasks like image recognition)
    3. Training the Model - During training, the model learns by adjusting itself to reduce mistakes.
       -use algorithms, minimize error
    4. Testing and Evaluation - After training, the model is tested on new, unseen data to check if it has generalized well
        i.e learned the actual pattern, not just memorized the training data.
    5. Improving the Model
       -Includes:
       Feeding it more data.
       Tuning the model's parameters.
       Using more advanced algorithms or techniques

# TYPES OF MACHINE LEARNING
    1. Supervised Learning(Labeled Data)
       a. Classification
       b. Predicting Outcome(Regression Problem)
    2. Unsupervised learning(process data without labeling or indications. It has to scan through all pictures)
       Labeling data is costly.(finds patterns in unlabeled data)
    3. Reinforcement Learning( operates without labelled data where a machine figures out how to reach the goal.)
       Learns by trial and error, getting rewards/penalties
